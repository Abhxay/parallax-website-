      <h2>What is a parallax website?</h2>
      <p>
        
    A parallax website is a dynamic and visually engaging type of web design that creates
    an illusion of depth by allowing different elements of a webpage to move at varying 
    speeds as the user scrolls. This effect is achieved by layering background and foreground
    elements, providing a three-dimensional feel to the browsing experience. As users navigate 
    through the site, they witness a subtle or pronounced scrolling effect, enhancing the overall
    interactivity and aesthetics. Parallax scrolling is often employed to tell a compelling story,
    showcase products, or present information in a more immersive manner. This design technique captivates
    visitors with its modern and sleek appearance, making the website visually appealing and memorable.
    By leveraging parallax scrolling, designers aim to create a more interactive and engaging user interface,
    providing a seamless blend of functionality and aesthetics for an enhanced online experience.

      <h2> Facts about Black Hole? </h2>
      <p>
        . The boundary surrounding a black hole is called the event horizon. Beyond this point,
         the gravitational pull is so intense that nothing can break free.

One intriguing feature is the phenomenon known as time dilation near a black hole. According to Einstein's theory o
f general relativity, time is not constant but can be affected by gravity. Near a black hole, where gravity is extremely 
strong, time slows down. This means that if you were observing someone from a safe distance near a black hole, 
you would see them moving in slow motion, and as they approached the event horizon, time for them would appear to almost stand still.

This time dilation effect has been experimentally confirmed with observations of objects orbiting around massive 
celestial bodies. It's a mind-bending concept that demonstrates how the fundamental forces of the universe can 
influence the very fabric of time itself.
